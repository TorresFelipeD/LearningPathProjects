There is a street described by a string S. Each character in S is one of the following:
- "<" denotes a car going to the left
- ">" denotes a car going to the right
- "." denotes a speed camera

Count the total number of times that cars pass by a speed camera. A car going to the left will pass every speed camera that is to the left of it, and similarly, a car going to the righ will pass every speed camera to the right of it.
Write a function.

That, given a string S of length N, returns the total number of times that cars pass by a speed camera.

Examples.

1. Given S = ".>...", the function should return 3. The car will pass by three speed cameras to the right of it.
2. Given S = ".>.<.>", the function should return 4. The first two cars will pass by two speed cameras each, and the third car will not pass by any.
3. Given S = ">>>.<<<", the function should return 3. Each car will pass one speed camera.
Assume that:
- N is an integer within the range [1...100];
- string S is made only of the following characters: '<','>' and/or '.'.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
